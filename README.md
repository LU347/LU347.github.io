# My Portfolio 🚧 👷‍♀️ WIP

I recreated my portfolio using Vite, React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

I left the project section blank for now, since most of them were small nor from course projects.

I am planning on building more complex projects and showcasing them here.

## Looking for Feedback 📚

Please advise on any improvements I should make, including recommendations for CSS best practices, coding standards, and efficiency. Thank you!
