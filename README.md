# My Portfolio 🚧 👷‍♀️ WIP

I recently remade my portfolio using Vite, React.js, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

I left the project page blank for now since most of them were small nor course projects.

I am planning on developing more complex projects and would showcase it here.

## Looking for Feedback 📚

Please advise on any improvements I should make, including recommendations for CSS best practices, coding standards, and efficiency. Thank you!
