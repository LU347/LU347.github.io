# My Portfolio 🚧 👷‍♀️ WIP

(09/03/24)
I am currently developing my website portfolio while concurrently enhancing my skills using Google's [web.dev](web.dev) resources.

Back then, I used HTML and CSS without fully understanding how they worked, especially CSS. I would often find free UI assets online, copy and paste them, and consider the job done.

## Here's what I learned the past couple of days:

1. Layouts:
   - Display
   - Margin
   - Padding
2. Responsive Design:
   - Flexbox
   - Grid
   - Media queries
   - min-width / max-width  
3. Sizing Units
   - vh, rem, fr, %
  
### To-Do

* Navbar sidebar for smaller screens
* About/Résumé/Projects/Contact Pages
* Blog (stretch)

## Looking for Feedback 📚

Please advise on any improvements I should make, including recommendations for CSS best practices, coding standards, and efficiency. Thank you!
